# Oh-My-Snow (OMS)

> Autonomous orchestration plugin for Snow CLI — turning AI coding sessions into reliable, self-driving workflows.

OMS wraps Snow CLI with a state machine, stage enforcement, auto-verification, and an orchestration loop that drives AI from goal to done — without losing track, skipping steps, or claiming success without actually making changes.

## Features

- 🔄 **Autonomous orchestration loop** — AI plans, executes, verifies, fixes, and completes work automatically
- 🚦 **Stage enforcement** — File edits are blocked during planning/verifying/done stages; the AI can't cheat the workflow
- 🔨 **Auto-verification** — Build/test runs automatically after every file edit during execution stage
- 📝 **Structured planning** — Tasks are tracked with completion status; the AI knows exactly what's left
- 🔍 **Text bypass detection** — If the AI claims to have made changes but `git diff` shows nothing, it gets called out
- 📸 **Snapshots** — Save and restore session state for long-running tasks
- 🎓 **Learning** — Extract reusable patterns from sessions into SKILL.md files
- 🤖 **18 specialized sub-agents** — Architecture, security, testing, research, and more, each with a structured `role` prompt ported from oh-my-claudecode (Role / Success Criteria / Constraints / Investigation Protocol / Final Checklist)
- 📚 **10 skills** — Knowledge base wiki, evidence-driven trace, ambiguity-gated interview, two-stage dive, visual-verdict QA, cleanup, research, learn, ralph, plan, and more
- 🛠️ **18 commands** — 10 workflow commands (auto, plan, qa, goal, verify, release, save, stop, team, help) + 8 skill-mapping commands (interview, dive, trace, cleanup, vverify, wiki, research, learn)

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g oh-my-snow
oms setup
```

The `oms setup` command:

1. Registers the MCP server in `~/.snow/settings.json`
2. Merges 18 sub-agents into `~/.snow/sub-agents.json`
3. Copies 10 skills to `~/.snow/skills/oms/`
4. Copies 18 commands to `~/.snow/commands/oms/` (10 workflow + 8 skill mappings)
5. Installs 4 hook configs to `~/.snow/hooks/` (global, with absolute path commands pointing to the npm package)
6. Creates `<project>/.snow/oms-state/` for session state (auto-created per project at runtime)

> **Note**: `oms setup` can be run from any directory — all components are installed globally. The `.snow/oms-state/` directory is auto-created in each project at runtime when an OMS session starts.

> **Note**: Hook commands use absolute paths to the npm package's `hooks/` directory (e.g., `node "/usr/local/lib/node_modules/oh-my-snow/hooks/before-tool-call.mjs"`), which is cross-platform compatible.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start an autonomous session — AI does everything: plan, execute, verify, fix, done
/oms:auto "Refactor the auth module to use JWT tokens"

# Plan first with user consensus, then execute
/oms:plan "Add user profile feature with avatar upload"

# Fix all build/test errors in a loop
/oms:qa "Fix TypeScript compilation errors after upgrading to v5"

# Get help
/oms:help
```

## Architecture Overview

OMS consists of **two systems** working together:

### System 1: MCP Server (State Management)

A stdio MCP server with 11 tools that manage the orchestration state file (`.snow/oms-state/state.json`) and skill state store (`.snow/oms-state/store/<mode>.json`). The AI calls these tools to start sessions, add tasks, transition stages, save snapshots, persist skill state, and learn patterns.

### System 2: Hooks (4 Lifecycle Hooks)

Shell scripts triggered by Snow CLI at specific lifecycle events:

| Hook             | Trigger                   | Purpose                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `beforeToolCall` | Before any tool executes  | Blocks file edits in non-editing stages (planning, verifying, done)                  |
| `afterToolCall`  | After a tool completes    | Schedules build/test verification after file edits in executing stage                |
| `onUserMessage`  | When user sends a message | Injects stage-aware guidance into the conversation                                   |
| `onStop`         | When AI finishes a turn   | Drives the orchestration loop — injects continuation prompts and detects text bypass |

### State Machine

```
planning → executing → verifying → done
             ▲           │
             └───────────┘
               (verify fail → back to executing, no fixing middle stage)
```

| Stage       | Description                           | File Edits                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `planning`  | Analyze codebase, create tasks        | ❌ Blocked                     |
| `executing` | Implement tasks with filesystem tools | ✅ Allowed (auto-verify after) |
| `verifying` | Review changes, run build/test        | ❌ Blocked                     |
| `done`      | Session complete                      | ❌ Blocked                     |

> **Note**: There is no `fixing` stage. When verification fails, the state transitions back to `executing` so the AI can fix issues and re-verify. A `done`-stage build failure also force-transitions to `executing`.

Load a skill with `/skill oms/<name>`, or use the corresponding `/oms:<name>` command (see the Skill-Mapping Commands section above) for a namespaced entry point:

| Skill           | Description                                                                      |

## Sub-Agents

Spawn a sub-agent with `#oms_<agent_name>`.

Each agent ships with a structured `role` prompt adapted from [oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)'s agent definitions — not a one-line description. The prompt follows a consistent tag structure: `<Role>` (responsibilities + handoff boundaries), `<Why_This_Matters>` (the rule's rationale), `<Success_Criteria>` (verifiable outcomes), `<Constraints>` (hard rules, e.g. read-only agents cannot edit), `<Investigation_Protocol>` (step-by-step method), `<Tool_Usage>` (snow-cli tool mapping + external consultation), `<Failure_Modes_To_Avoid>`, and `<Final_Checklist>`. Every agent also declares a `<Final_Response_Contract>` requiring a structured deliverable in its last message — no content-free "done" sign-offs.

**Mapping to omc roles**: `oms_architect`→architect, `oms_reviewer`→code-reviewer, `oms_tester`→test-engineer, `oms_security`→security-reviewer, `oms_ds`→scientist, `oms_docs`→writer, `oms_evaluator`→verifier, `oms_critic`→critic, `oms_designer`→designer, `oms_researcher`→explore+scientist+document-specialist. The role-specialized agents (`oms_frontend`, `oms_backend`, `oms_database`, `oms_api`, `oms_devops`, `oms_optimizer`, `oms_migrator`, `oms_summarizer`) use the executor pattern with domain-specific protocols.

Tool names and collaboration references are adapted to snow-cli: `Glob/Grep/Read`→`filesystem-read`+`ace-search`, `Write/Edit`→`filesystem-create/edit/replaceedit`, `Bash`→`terminal-execute`, `lsp_diagnostics*`→`ide-get_diagnostics`, `WebSearch/WebFetch`→`websearch-search`/`websearch-fetch`, `Task(subagent_type=...)`→`#oms_<name>`, `/team`→`/oms:team`.

## Configuration Reference

### Settings File

`~/.snow/settings.json` — MCP server configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"oms": {
			"command": "node",
			"args": ["/absolute/path/to/oh-my-snow/dist/mcp-server.js"],
			"timeout": 300000,
			"enabled": true
		}
	}
}
```

### Sub-Agents File

`~/.snow/sub-agents.json` — Agent definitions:

```json
{
	"agents": [
		{
			"id": "oms_architect",
			"name": "OMS Architect",
			"description": "System architecture design and review",
			"systemPrompt": "...",
			"tools": ["filesystem-read", "codebase-search", "ace-search"]
		}
	]
}
```

### State File

`<project>/.snow/oms-state/state.json` — Session state (created at runtime):

```json
{
  "sessionId": "oms_1700000000000",
  "stage": "planning",
  "goal": "Refactor auth module",
  "verifyCommand": "npm test",
  "tasks": [
    { "id": "task_1", "description": "Analyze current auth", "completed": true }
  ],
  "turnCount": 3,
  "stageHistory": [...],
  "logs": [...],
  "snapshots": []
}
```

### Skill State Store

`<project>/.snow/oms-state/store/<mode>.json` — Per-mode skill state (one JSON file per mode, e.g. `interview.json`, `trace.json`, `deep-dive.json`). Managed via the `oms-state` MCP tool by skills themselves (read-modify-write with overwrite semantics), not the orchestration state machine.

### Hook Configuration

`<project>/.snow/hooks/beforeToolCall.json`:

```json
[
	{
		"matcher": "filesystem-create,filesystem-edit,filesystem-replaceedit,terminal-execute",
		"description": "OMS: Block file edits and terminal commands in non-editing stages",
		"hooks": [
			{
				"type": "command",
				"command": "node .snow/oms-state/before-tool-call.mjs",
				"timeout": 5000,
				"enabled": true
			}
		]
	}
]
```

## Uninstall

```bash
oms uninstall
```

This command:

1. Removes the MCP server from `~/.snow/settings.json`
2. Removes all `oms_*` agents from `~/.snow/sub-agents.json`
3. Removes `~/.snow/skills/oms/` directory
4. Removes `~/.snow/commands/oms/` directory
5. Removes OMS hook rules from `<project>/.snow/hooks/*.json`
6. Removes `<project>/.snow/oms-state/` directory
